Akshaye Khanna plays Bharat, a bank cashier and a part-time Hanuman in a local Ramleela. He lives a simple life with his wife Nisha (Shriya Saran), a school teacher, and his father Shivnarayan (Satish Kaushik), a freedom fighter. His life turns upside down when he is falsely accused of stealing a fan from his own house by a corrupt cop Kushwaah (Annu Kapoor) and a crooked witness Bachhu (Rajat Rawail). He is dragged to court and has to face a series of bribes, threats and humiliations from various authorities, including the local MLA Manku (Murli Sharma) and his brother Sattu (Amit Mistry), who play Ram and Ravan in the same Ramleela.
 
The movie is a satire on the plight of the common man who is trapped in a vicious circle of corruption and has no escape. The movie also takes a dig at the political scenario, the media, the judiciary and the police system in India. The movie has some witty dialogues and humorous situations that make it entertaining. The movie also has an item number by Veena Malik called Chhanno, which adds some spice to the film.
 
The performances of the actors are commendable, especially Akshaye Khanna, who portrays the frustration and helplessness of Bharat with conviction. Shriya Saran and Mugdha Godse, who play his wife and his colleague respectively, are decent in their roles. Annu Kapoor, Rajat Rawail, Murli Sharma and Amit Mistry are hilarious as the corrupt characters. Satish Kaushik and Vijay Raaz, who play Bharat's father and a thief respectively, are also impressive.
 
The music of the film is composed by Anu Malik and is average. The cinematography by Gururaj Jois is good and captures the essence of Bhopal, where the film is set. The editing by A. Muthu is crisp and keeps the pace of the film. The direction by Rumi Jaffery is decent and he manages to convey his message with humor.

Gali Gali Chor Hai is a movie that tries to highlight the serious issue of corruption in India with a comic twist. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a decent attempt to make people aware of the reality and also entertain them at the same time.
  
The movie is not without its flaws. The plot is predictable and the climax is abrupt. The movie also lacks depth and subtlety in its portrayal of corruption. The movie could have explored the psychological and emotional impact of corruption on the common man and his family. The movie also fails to offer any solution or hope for the situation.
 
The movie is a one-time watch for those who enjoy satirical comedies and want to see Akshaye Khanna in a different avatar. The movie is not a masterpiece, but it is a decent attempt to make people aware of the reality and also entertain them at the same time.
