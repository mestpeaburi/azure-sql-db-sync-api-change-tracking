Rune: Halls of Valhalla is a multiplayer expansion pack for the action-adventure game Rune, developed by Human Head Studios and released in 2001. The game features a variety of game modes, maps, weapons, and characters based on Norse mythology. One of the most popular game modes is the tournament mode, where players compete in a series of matches to determine the ultimate champion.
 
However, not everyone plays fair in the tournament mode. Some players use cheats, hacks, or exploits to gain an unfair advantage over their opponents. These cheats can range from simple codes that grant invincibility, infinite ammo, or flying abilities, to more complex hacks that modify the game files or memory. Some cheats are even hidden in the game itself, such as secret items or characters that can be summoned with certain commands.

## Cheat Codes
 
The easiest way to cheat in Rune: Halls of Valhalla tournament mode is to use cheat codes. These are commands that you can enter in the console by pressing the Tab or ~ key during the game. However, before you can use cheat codes, you need to enable cheat mode by typing "cheatplease" in the console. Once cheat mode is enabled, you can enter any of the following codes to activate various effects:
 
- god: Makes you invincible.
- fly: Allows you to fly.
- invisible: Makes you invisible.
- amphibious: Gives you infinite air underwater.
- killpawns: Kills all enemies on the map.
- open [map name]: Skips to any map of your choice.
- summon [item name]: Spawns any item or character of your choice.
- preferences: Opens the advanced options menu.

You can find a list of all the available items and characters that you can summon with the "summon" code on various websites or forums. Some examples are:

- VikingShortSword: A basic sword.
- VikingShield: A basic shield.
- RuneOfPower: A rune that increases your damage.
- RuneOfHealth: A rune that heals you.
- RuneOfStrength: A rune that increases your strength.
- DarkShield: A shield that reflects projectiles.
- RustyMace: A powerful mace.
- RomanSword: A sword that shoots fireballs.
- SigurdAxe: An axe that belongs to Sigurd, a secret character.
- Torch: A torch that can be used as a weapon or a light source.
- PlayerSigurd: Summons Sigurd as a playable character.
- PlayerAlric: Summons Alric as a playable character.
- PlayerDarkViking: Summons a dark viking as a playable character.
- PlayerElder: Summons an elder as a playable character.
- PlayerLokiGuard: Summons a loki guard as a playable character.

Cheat codes are very easy to use and can give you a huge advantage in the tournament mode. However, they also have some drawbacks. First of all, cheat codes are very obvious and noticeable by other players and spectators. If you use cheat codes, you will likely be reported and banned from the server or the tournament. Second, cheat codes can also affect your own gameplay experience negatively. For example, if you use god mode or killpawns, you will not be able to enjoy the challenge and thrill of the game. If you use summon codes, you will not be able to collect items or weapons normally. If you use open codes, you will miss out on the story and progression of the game. Therefore, cheat codes are best used sparingly and discreetly, or for fun and experimentation only.
