## The Origins of Now!
 
The idea for *Now!* was conceived in the office of Virgin Records in London by Stephen Navin, the head of Licensing and Business Affairs, and Jon Webster, the General Manager. They wanted to create a compilation album that would feature the best songs from different record labels, something that had not been done before. They pitched the idea to Simon Draper, the managing director of Virgin Records, and Peter Jamieson, the managing director of EMI Records, who agreed to collaborate on the project. The deal was finalized on Richard Branson's boat in Little Venice.

The name and logo of the series were inspired by a 1920s British advertising poster for Danish Bacon, which showed a pig listening to a chicken singing and saying "Now. That's What I Call Music". Richard Branson had bought the poster for his cousin, Simon Draper, who hung it behind his desk at Virgin Records. The pig became the mascot for the series, appearing on the covers until *Now! 5*, and making occasional comebacks in later editions.
 
## The Evolution of Now!
 
The first *Now!* album was released on 28 November 1983 on vinyl, cassette and CD. It featured 30 UK hit singles from that year, including 11 number ones. It was an instant success, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart and selling over a million copies. Since then, *Now!* has released two or three albums per year, usually coinciding with Easter, summer and Christmas seasons. The series has also expanded to include spin-offs such as *Now Dance*, *Now That's What I Call Music! Decades*, *Now That's What I Call Classic Rock*, and many more.
