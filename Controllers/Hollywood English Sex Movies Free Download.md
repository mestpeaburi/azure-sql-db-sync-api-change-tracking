The organization that was established by the major Hollywood studios to regulate the content of their films was originally named the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. It was commonly referred to as the Hays Office after its first president, Will Hays, who was a former politician and lawyer. Under his leadership, the organization created the Motion Picture Production Code in nineteen thirty, which was a set of moral guidelines for filmmakers to follow. The purpose of the code was to allow the film industry to self-censor its products and avoid government interference. The Hays Office had the power to review and approve every film before it could be distributed to the public.
  
The Motion Picture Production Code was based on a list of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" that Hays had compiled in nineteen twenty-seven. The code covered topics such as sex, violence, crime, religion, and patriotism. It prohibited the depiction of nudity, adultery, profanity, drug use, and interracial relationships. It also required that criminals and villains be punished and that good always triumph over evil. The code also banned any scenes that could offend or ridicule any nation, race, or creed.

The Hays Office enforced the code by assigning a team of examiners to review every film script and finished product. The examiners could suggest or demand changes to the films to make them comply with the code. If a film did not receive the Hays Office seal of approval, it could not be shown in most theaters across the country. The studios had to pay a fee for each film they submitted to the Hays Office and a fine for each film they released without approval.
  
The code was widely accepted by the film industry and the public for several years. It helped to create a uniform standard of morality and quality for American films. It also helped to protect the film industry from censorship laws and boycotts by religious and civic groups. However, the code also faced criticism and challenges from some filmmakers, critics, and audiences who felt that it was too restrictive and outdated. The code gradually lost its influence and effectiveness in the nineteen fifties and sixties due to social changes, legal rulings, foreign films, and television. The code was officially abandoned in nineteen sixty-eight and replaced by the current rating system.
